   ## About this project
   ### WiFi captive portal for the NodeMCU (ESP8266 Module) with DNS spoofing.
  - A login page will appear when someone connects to this "Free WiFi".
  - It asks the user for an email and a password for a fake sign in.
  - The built-in LED will blink 3 times after the login process is completed by someone.<b>
